# Overview

What I am trying to accomplish with writing this code, is to see how hard creating pixel art games might be. Yes this is super beginner stuff, but it gives me an idea of it.

The software I used to write the code is Thonny, its an easy development environment for Python. 

The Reason why I wrote this, is because I wanted to create something fun for the Holiday, so instead orignal hangman, we made it more Halloween theme.

# Development Environment

Tools:
-Thonny - like I said above, its good to use for beginners in Python.
-Photoshop - More complex tool for digital design(still learning a lot myself)

Language
-Python
--pygame
--random

# Future Work

- Work on setting a background image, to what I have designed.
- Work on scaling, with everything inside the screen.
- Work on my pixel art.
- Work on my Python skills, and learn more about pygame/arcade.
